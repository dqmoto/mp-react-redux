# mp-react-redux
WORK IN PROGRESS - Webapp version of existing iOS app.

*This is built off of a tutorial by Andrew Mead on Udemy.com 'The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)'
This project uses the 'Expensify' project as a boilerplate/foundation. The additions beyond the tutorial elements are the linking to the data and updating and expansion of the components and their functionality. However, much of the structure is the same.
Thank you Andrew.*
